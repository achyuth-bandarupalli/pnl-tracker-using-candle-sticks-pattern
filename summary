P&L Tracker Web App  A simple, browser-based P&L (Profit & Loss) tracker that visualizes your trading performance 
using candlestick charts built with TradingView’s Lightweight Charts.

you need to run it in vs code and need to go live otherwise javascript doesnt run in the backend by simply opening the html file  

########### 
All data is stored locally in your browser using localStorage. This means:
No server or database is required.
Your P&L data persists between sessions (until manually cleared).
All data stays private on your own device.
⚠️ Note: Clearing browser cache or switching devices will erase your saved data.
